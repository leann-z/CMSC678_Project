# **Enhancing Smart Grid Security: Anomaly and Novelty Detection for Electricity Theft**  

## **Project Overview**  
Electricity theft is a significant challenge for modern smart grids, leading to financial losses and grid instability. This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques for **anomaly and novelty detection** in electricity consumption data. By leveraging models such as **XGBoost, LSTM, Random Forest, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**, the study explores methods to detect electricity theft while handling **class imbalance, contextual anomalies, and previously unseen patterns.**  

## **Features & Contributions**  
- **Anomaly Detection:**  
  - Implemented **XGBoost** for theft detection, achieving **80% accuracy and 66% recall** after threshold adjustments.  
  - Developed an **LSTM-based approach** for capturing temporal dependencies in electricity consumption data, improving accuracy to **91%**.  
- **Novelty Detection:**  
  - Applied **Random Forest** and **LOF** models to detect unseen and rare consumption patterns, achieving **90% accuracy** in identifying novel anomalies.  
  - Used **synthetic novelty injection** to improve model robustness.  
- **Performance Analysis:**  
  - Evaluated models based on **precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and AUROC curves** to balance detection accuracy and false positive rates.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Machine Learning Models:** XGBoost, LSTM, Random Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest  
- **Libraries & Tools:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Handling:** Time-series preprocessing, class balancing with **SMOTE**, feature scaling with **StandardScaler**  


## **Results Summary**  
| Model | Accuracy | Recall (Anomaly) | AUROC Score | Key Findings |  
|--------|----------|----------------|------------|--------------|  
| XGBoost | 80% | 66% | 0.81 | Good for binary classification but lacks time-series awareness |  
| LSTM | 91% | 5% | 0.74 | Captures sequential data but struggles with imbalanced data |  
| Random Forest | 90% | 88% | 0.90 | Effective for novelty detection |  
| LOF | - | 88% | 0.77 | Best at detecting unseen anomalies but generates some false positives |  

## **Future Improvements**  
- Fine-tune **LSTM hyperparameters** for better anomaly recall.  
- Implement a **hybrid approach** combining XGBoost and LSTM.  
- Explore **unsupervised learning techniques** like Autoencoders for anomaly detection.
